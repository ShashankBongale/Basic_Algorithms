# DAA_CODE
This Repository contains all the codes for implementation of basic algorithms.For each algorithms there is a client,implentation,
input and output files.For each individual input the output must be checked with the given output files with 'diff' command.
#Commands
1)gcc -c source_file.c                               //to generate the object file of the source file
2)gcc client_file.c source_file.o -o a.out          //to link clinet file with the object file created in the previous step and storing
                                                   //the executable file in a.out
3)./a.out<input_file>output                       //to run executable file with the given input and storing the generated output
4)diff output given_output                       //comparing the generated output in the previous step with the giben output.
